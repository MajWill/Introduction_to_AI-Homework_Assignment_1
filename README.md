## Exercise 1 and Exercise 2

- [AI.pdf](AI.pdf) contain the text with our findings about exercise 1 and the text about our presentation for exercise 2.
- [BiasPresentation.pdf](BiasPresentation.pdf) is a PDF presentation with slides for the exercise 2.

## Exercise 3
The folder [Exercise-3](Exercise-3) contains all the necessary files for the implementation of the vacuum cleaner exercise.

We programmed the first part using the existing Agent class but with a Simple Reflex. To calculate the total score, executed 3 nested loops for every possible combination of starting conditions and clean/dirty.

We Programmed the second request by rewriting the Agent model with functions implemented by us in the [vacuum_2d.py](Exercise-3/vacuum_2d.py) file. See notebooks for greater details.
